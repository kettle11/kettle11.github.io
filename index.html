	<h1>Wabi: Elegantly Build Websites</h1>
		<p><br>
Wabi is very simple.<br>
<br>
1. Download Wabi<br>
2. Put Wabi somewhere<br>
3. Click on it to begin<br>
<br>
Now you have a static website generated with a template you can edit and a folder you can put posts into. <br>
<br>
When you're ready to upload your website just type &quot;publish&quot; and Wabi will upload any changes to your Git repository.<br>
<br>
Have fun!</p>
