<h2>Microsoft HoloLens</h2>

<p><br>
I worked on the HoloLens at Microsoft where I was responsible for a variety of front-end components related to the HoloLens &quot;shell&quot;. I was involved in various UI / UX prototyping efforts working with the HoloLens design, prototyping, product management, and engineering teams. I also worked on the first generation of Microsoft Mixed Reality headsets and helped develop the Mixed Reality shell for the platform.<br>

<h2>PhotoSynth 2</h2>

<p>I did two summer internships with the Photosynth team at Microsoft. During my first internship I prototyped the user experience and interaction for a 3D annotations feature for photogammetry data. This feature shipped as part of &quot;Photosynth 2&quot; and enabled a rich community of annoted photogammetry. <br>
<br>
During my second internship I developed and prototyped interactions for a secretive emerging AR platform within Microsoft that later was revealed to be the HoloLens.<br>

<h2>Moxi Music</h2>

<p>As a personal project I set out to make the best music app for Windows Phone and Windows. The goal was to create something that was powerful and aesthetically pleasing. I wanted to bring the polish of apps in the Apple ecosystem to a Windows app. A core feature of Moxi was integration into OneDrive, providing the advantages of cloud services and the strengths of a native app.<br>

<h2>Color Bird</h2>

<p>When looking at a sunset I wanted to extract a gradient to use in a game I was working on. A few others and I created &quot;Color Bird&quot; to gather the primary colors from regions of photos. A user could simply swipe in a circle around an area and Color Bird would give them the colors from that area. The app was released on Android for the Google Play store.<br>

<h2>Kajo</h2>

<p>Kajo is a first person platforming adventure. The game evokes a feeling of wonder and was designed to encourage mastery of game mechanics and levels through repeated playthroughs. It was created as a student project and accepted to Steam Greenlight (back when that was an exclusive thing). I created the initial concept and designed/developed the gameplay along with a team of other students.<br>

<h2>Generative artwork (2008 and earlier)</h2>

<p>As a 13 year old I got into programming by creating generative art in a programming environment called &quot;NetLogo&quot;. Below are a few samples. <br>
