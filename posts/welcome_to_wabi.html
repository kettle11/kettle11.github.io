		<h1>Welcome to Wabi!</h1>
		<p>Wabi is a work in progress. Check back later to learn more!</p>

<p>As I work on Wabi I've been updating this page to test out Git integration. Today I made Git integration work super seamlessly! Git isn't hard, but often times when you're in a creative or flow state you don't want to remember exact git commands. Wabi handles all that Git stuff for you so you just type &quot;Publish&quot; and your work is online!</p>

<p>To update your website with Wabi run just one command: &quot;publish&quot;. Your new website will be online in seconds.</p>

<p>Wabi is super fast!</p>

<p>Things I'm working on right now for Wabi:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Easy Git integration (No messing around with git commands, unless you want to!)</p></li>

<li><p>Pagination</p></li>

<li><p>General code cleanup</p></li>
</ul>
